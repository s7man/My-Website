<h1>Engineering Economics and Project</h1>

<h2>Unit - i: Introduction, Theory of Demand & Supply</h2>

<h3>1. Introduction to Engineering Economics</h3>
<p><strong>Importance of Economics in Engineering Decision-Making:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Engineering economics is a branch of economics that applies microeconomic techniques to engineering projects to determine their feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability.</li>
    <li><strong>Importance:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Engineers face decisions about resource allocation, product design, and process efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Designing a bridge involves choosing materials, labor, and technology, all of which depend on cost constraints and expected benefits.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Relationship Between Engineering and Economics:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Engineering provides technical solutions, while economics evaluates whether these solutions are financially and socially viable.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> A new manufacturing process might reduce costs but could require significant upfront investment. Economics evaluates the trade-offs to ensure profitability.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Resource Management:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Scarcity of Resources:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Scarcity means that resources (natural, human, financial) are limited compared to their demand.</li>
            <li>Engineers must work within these limits to find efficient solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> A solar panel project in a rural area might be limited by available sunlight, land, or funding.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Efficient Utilization of Limited Resources:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Efficiency ensures maximum output with minimum input.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lean Manufacturing: Minimizes waste in production processes.</li>
                    <li>Energy Efficiency: Using energy-saving devices like LEDs instead of incandescent bulbs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Opportunity Costs and Rational Decision-Making:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Opportunity Cost:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The value of the next best alternative that is forgone when a choice is made.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> If a company spends ₹1 crore on a new machine, it loses the opportunity to invest in another profitable project.</li>
            <li><strong>Practical Use:</strong> Helps engineers and managers prioritize projects or resource allocation.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Rational Choice Theory:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Decision-making based on comparing costs and benefits to maximize satisfaction.</li>
            <li><strong>Example in Engineering:</strong> When choosing between two manufacturing techniques, the one with the highest cost-benefit ratio is selected.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Theory of Demand:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Law of Demand:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> As the price of a product falls, the quantity demanded increases (and vice versa), assuming all other factors remain constant.</li>
            <li><strong>Graphical Representation:</strong> Demand curve slopes downward from left to right.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Types of Demand:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Individual Demand: The quantity demanded by a single consumer at a given price.</li>
            <li>Market Demand: The total quantity demanded by all consumers in the market.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Determinants of Demand:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Price of the good.</li>
            <li>Income of consumers.</li>
            <li>Prices of related goods (substitutes and complements).</li>
            <li>Consumer tastes and preferences.</li>
            <li>Expectations about future prices.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Demand Function:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>A mathematical expression showing the relationship between quantity demanded and its determinants.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Qd = a - bP, where:
                <ul>
                    <li>Qd: Quantity demanded.</li>
                    <li>P: Price.</li>
                    <li>a and b: Constants.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Price Elasticity of Demand:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Measures the responsiveness of demand to a change in price.</li>
            <li><strong>Formula:</strong> Ep = % Δ Qd / % Δ P = Δ Qd / Qd / Δ P / P</li>
            <li><strong>Elastic Goods:</strong> Demand changes significantly with price (luxury items).</li>
            <li><strong>Inelastic Goods:</strong> Demand barely changes with price (necessities).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Theory of Supply:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Determinants of Supply:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Price of the product.</li>
            <li>Cost of production (materials, labor, etc.).</li>
            <li>Technological advancements.</li>
            <li>Government policies (taxes, subsidies).</li>
            <li>Market expectations.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Supply Function:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>A mathematical relationship between the quantity supplied and its determinants.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Qs = c + dP, where:
                <ul>
                    <li>Qs: Quantity supplied.</li>
                    <li>P: Price.</li>
                    <li>c and d: Constants.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Market Mechanism:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Equilibrium (Price and Quantity):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The point where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.</li>
            <li><strong>Graphical Representation:</strong> Demand and supply curves intersect at the equilibrium price and quantity.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Basic Comparative Static Analysis:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Analyzing how shifts in demand or supply curves affect equilibrium price and quantity.</li>
            <li><strong>Example Scenarios:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increase in Demand: Shifts the demand curve to the right. Equilibrium price and quantity both increase.</li>
                    <li>Decrease in Supply: Shifts the supply curve to the left. Equilibrium price increases, but quantity decreases.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Numerical Problem Example:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Demand Function: Qd = 50 - 2P</li>
            <li>Supply Function: Qs = 10 + 3P</li>
            <li>Equilibrium:
                <ul>
                    <li>At equilibrium, Qd = Qs: 50 - 2P = 10 + 3P</li>
                    <li>40 = 5P ⟹ P = 8</li>
                    <li>Substituting P = 8 into either function gives Q = 34.</li>
                    <li>Equilibrium price = ₹8, Equilibrium quantity = 34 units.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Unit - ii: Theory of Production & Costs</h2>

<h3>1. Concept of Production:</h3>
<p><strong>Understanding Production in Terms of Goods and Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Production:</strong> The process of creating goods and services by utilizing resources (land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship).</li>
    <li><strong>Goods:</strong> Physical, tangible products (e.g., cars, phones).</li>
    <li><strong>Services:</strong> Intangible outputs (e.g., education, healthcare).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Factors of Production:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Land: Natural resources used for production (e.g., minerals, land for factories).</li>
    <li>Labor: Human effort, both physical and mental.</li>
    <li>Capital: Man-made tools and machinery used in production (e.g., equipment, infrastructure).</li>
    <li>Entrepreneurship: The managerial and innovative skills to combine resources efficiently.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixed and Variable Factors:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fixed Factors:</strong> Resources that do not change with the level of output in the short run (e.g., factory building, machinery).</li>
    <li><strong>Variable Factors:</strong> Resources that change with the level of output (e.g., labor, raw materials).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Short-Run Production Function:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Shows the relationship between input (labor or capital) and output when at least one input is fixed.</li>
    <li><strong>Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Initially, adding more variable factors (e.g., labor) increases output at an increasing rate.</li>
            <li>Eventually, the output increases at a decreasing rate, and finally, it may decline.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Graphical Illustration:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The Total Product (TP) curve shows the total output.</li>
            <li>Marginal Product (MP): Additional output from one more unit of input.</li>
            <li>Average Product (AP): Output per unit of input.</li>
            <li><strong>Relationship:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>When MP > AP: AP is rising.</li>
                    <li>When MP < AP: AP is falling.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Long-Run Production Function:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> All inputs are variable in the long run, and firms can change the scale of production.</li>
    <li><strong>Returns to Scale:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Describes the change in output when all inputs are increased proportionally.</li>
            <li><strong>Types of Returns:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increasing Returns to Scale: Output increases more than the proportional increase in inputs.</li>
                    <li>Constant Returns to Scale: Output increases in the same proportion as inputs.</li>
                    <li>Decreasing Returns to Scale: Output increases less than the proportional increase in inputs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Theory of Costs:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Short-Run Cost Curves:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>In the short run, some factors are fixed, leading to specific cost behaviors.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Short-Run Cost Concepts:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Total Cost (TC):</strong> Sum of all costs at a given level of production. <br> TC = TFC + TVC</li>
                    <li><strong>Total Fixed Cost (TFC):</strong> Costs that remain constant regardless of output (e.g., rent).</li>
                    <li><strong>Total Variable Cost (TVC):</strong> Costs that vary with output (e.g., raw materials, labor).</li>
                    <li><strong>Average Cost (AC):</strong> Cost per unit of output. <br> AC = TC / Q</li>
                    <li><strong>Marginal Cost (MC):</strong> Additional cost of producing one more unit. <br> MC = Δ TC / Δ Q</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Graphical Representation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>TFC is horizontal since it doesn’t change.</li>
                    <li>TVC increases as output increases.</li>
                    <li>TC is the sum of TFC and TVC.</li>
                    <li><strong>Average and Marginal Cost Curves:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>MC intersects AC and AVC at their minimum points.</li>
                            <li>AVC and AC approach each other as output increases since AFC (Average Fixed Cost) decreases.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Long-Run Cost Curves:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>In the long run, all costs are variable.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-Run Average Cost (LRAC):</strong> A curve showing the minimum average cost at each output level when all inputs are variable.</li>
            <li><strong>Economies of Scale:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cost advantages due to large-scale production.</li>
                    <li><strong>Types:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Internal Economies: Within a firm (e.g., bulk purchasing, technical efficiency).</li>
                            <li>External Economies: Within the industry (e.g., improved infrastructure).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Diseconomies of Scale:</strong> Increasing costs due to management inefficiencies as the firm grows.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Economic Concept of Profit:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Understanding Profit:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Profit:</strong> The financial gain when total revenue exceeds total cost. <br> Profit = Total Revenue (TR) - Total Cost (TC)</li>
            <li><strong>Types of Profit:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Normal Profit: Minimum profit required to keep a business operational.</li>
                    <li>Supernormal Profit: Profit exceeding normal profit.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Profit Maximization:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>A firm maximizes profit when: Marginal Cost (MC) = Marginal Revenue (MR): The additional cost of producing one more unit equals the additional revenue.</li>
            <li><strong>Graphical Representation:</strong> At the profit-maximizing point, the distance between TR and TC is the greatest.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Numerical Problem Example:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Total Revenue (TR) Function:</strong> TR = 100Q - 2Q²</li>
            <li><strong>Total Cost (TC) Function:</strong> TC = 50 + 20Q + Q²</li>
            <li><strong>Profit Maximization:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Profit Function:</strong> Profit = TR - TC = (100Q - 2Q²) - (50 + 20Q + Q²) <br> Profit = 80Q - 3Q² - 50</li>
                    <li><strong>First Derivative:</strong> dProfit/dQ = 80 - 6Q = 0 <br> Q = 13.33</li>
                    <li>Substitute Q = 13.33 into the TR and TC functions to calculate profit.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Unit - iii: Different Types of Market and Role of Government</h2>

<h3>1. Perfect Competition:</h3>
<p><strong>Characteristics and Features of Perfectly Competitive Markets:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Perfect competition is a market structure characterized by ideal conditions for competition among firms. Key features include:</li>
    <li><strong>1. Large Number of Buyers and Sellers:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>There are so many participants that no single buyer or seller can influence the market price.</li>
            <li>The market price is determined by aggregate demand and supply.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>2. Homogeneous Products:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>All firms produce identical or perfectly substitutable products.</li>
            <li>Consumers are indifferent to the choice of seller.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>3. Free Entry and Exit:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Firms can enter or leave the market without significant barriers (e.g., no regulatory hurdles or high capital requirements).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>4. Perfect Information:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Buyers and sellers have complete knowledge about prices, products, and market conditions.</li>
            <li>This ensures that all participants make informed decisions.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>5. Price Takers:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Firms and consumers accept the market price as given since no single participant has the power to influence it.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>6. Profit Maximization:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Firms aim to produce at a level where Marginal Cost (MC) = Marginal Revenue (MR) to maximize profit.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>7. No Government Intervention:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The market operates purely on the forces of demand and supply.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Graphical Illustration:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The firm’s demand curve is perfectly elastic (horizontal) at the market price since it can sell any quantity at that price.</li>
    <li>Profit maximization occurs where the MC curve intersects the MR curve.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example of Perfect Competition:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Agricultural markets (e.g., wheat, rice, or other grains) often approximate perfect competition due to the standardized nature of the product.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Imperfect Competition:</h3>
<p><strong>Overview of Monopoly:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> A market structure where a single seller controls the entire supply of a product or service.</li>
    <li><strong>Key Features:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Single Seller: The firm is the sole producer, with no close substitutes for its product.</li>
            <li>Barriers to Entry: High entry barriers prevent other firms from entering the market (e.g., legal restrictions, economies of scale, or resource ownership).</li>
            <li>Price Maker: The monopolist determines the price of its product.</li>
            <li>Lack of Competition: Consumers have no alternative but to buy from the monopolist.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Utility providers like electricity or water companies in some regions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Monopolistic Competition:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> A market structure where many firms sell similar but not identical products.</li>
    <li><strong>Key Features:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Product Differentiation: Firms sell products with unique features, branding, or quality.</li>
            <li>Large Number of Firms: Many sellers compete, but each has some degree of market power.</li>
            <li>Non-Price Competition: Firms compete through advertising, branding, and product features rather than price.</li>
            <li>Freedom of Entry and Exit: Barriers to entry and exit are relatively low.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> The market for restaurants, clothing brands, or cosmetic products.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Oligopoly:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> A market structure where a few large firms dominate the market.</li>
    <li><strong>Key Features:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Few Sellers: A small number of firms hold significant market share.</li>
            <li>Interdependence: Firms consider the actions of competitors when making decisions (e.g., pricing, advertising).</li>
            <li>Barriers to Entry: High costs or complex technology act as barriers to new entrants.</li>
            <li>Price Rigidity: Prices tend to remain stable because firms fear starting a price war.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Automobile manufacturers (e.g., Toyota, Ford, Hyundai) or smartphone markets.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Government's Role in the Economy:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>In Socialist Economies:</strong>
