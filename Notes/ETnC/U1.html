    <h1>Unit 1: Electrical Safety</h1>
    
    <h2>1.1. Safety for Domestic Electrical Appliances</h2>
    <p>Electrical appliances are vital in households but can pose risks such as electric shocks, fires, or damage if improperly handled. Following safety practices is essential to prevent accidents.</p>
    
    <h3>a. Do’s:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Read the User Manual: Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for operation, maintenance, and safety precautions.</li>
            <li>Use Proper Wiring: Ensure appliances are connected to properly grounded outlets and correctly wired circuits.</li>
            <li>Check for Damage: Regularly inspect cords, plugs, and outlets for signs of wear, damage, or fraying.</li>
            <li>Turn Off After Use: Switch off and unplug appliances when not in use to prevent overheating, fires, or accidental activation.</li>
            <li>Install Circuit Protection: Use Residual Current Devices (RCDs) or circuit breakers to protect against electrical shocks and overcurrent.</li>
            <li>Dry Hands and Surroundings: Always operate electrical appliances with dry hands and ensure the area around them is dry to prevent electric shocks.</li>
            <li>Childproof Your Home: Use outlet covers and keep appliances out of children's reach.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>b. Don’ts:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Don’t Press Unknown Switches: Avoid pressing switches unless you are sure of their function and safety.</li>
        <li>Don’t Operate or Tamper with Electrical Equipment: Never modify electrical gear or wiring unless you're qualified.</li>
        <li>Don’t Work on Live Circuits: Only authorized personnel should work on live circuits.</li>
        <li>Don’t Disconnect Grounding Connections: Always maintain the earth connection to prevent electrical shocks.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>1.2. Industrial Electrical Safety</h2>
    <h3>a. During Operation:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Wear PPE: Always use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).</li>
        <li>Follow Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) procedures.</li>
        <li>Use Insulated Tools rated for the voltage level.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>1.3. Rescue Procedures for Electric Shock</h2>
    <h3>Immediate Action:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Isolate the Victim: Quickly remove the person from contact with the electrical source.</li>
        <li>Cut Power: Immediately switch off the nearest circuit breaker.</li>
        <li>Start Artificial Respiration: Begin CPR if the person is not breathing.</li>
    </ul>
