        Cut Power:
      Switch Off: Immediately switch off the nearest circuit breaker or disconnect the switch to stop the electrical flow.
        Start Artificial Respiration:
      CPR Initiation: If the person is not breathing, begin CPR immediately, performing chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth breathing if necessary.
        Stop Bleeding:
      Control Bleeding: If there is visible bleeding, use a clean cloth or bandage to apply pressure to stop the blood flow.
        Position the Person:
      Lower the Head: Lower the person’s head slightly to ensure better blood circulation to the brain.
        Ensure Proper Ventilation and Calm:
      Clear the Area: Keep the area clear of unnecessary onlookers and provide good ventilation. Stay calm to prevent further stress or confusion.
        Avoid Giving Drinks:
      Do Not Offer Drinks: Avoid giving the person anything to drink, especially if they are unconscious or semi-conscious.
        Call for Emergency Assistance:
      Seek Professional Help: Call a doctor or emergency services immediately, and provide them with the situation details.
        Maintain Calm:
      Stay Calm: Keep the environment calm and avoid unnecessary panic. Focus on the task and reassure the injured person (if conscious).
        Methods of Providing CPR (Artificial Respiration)
        Chest Compressions:
        Hand Placement: Place the heel of one hand in the center of the chest, just below the sternum. Place the other hand on top of the first and interlace the fingers.
        Compressions: Push down hard and fast at a rate of 100–120 compressions per minute. Ensure that each compression is about 2 inches (5 cm) deep to circulate blood effectively.
        Rescue Breaths:
        Open the Airway: Tilt the person's head back slightly and lift the chin to open the airway. Pinch the nose shut to prevent air from escaping.
        Give Two Breaths: Give two slow, deep breaths into the person’s mouth, ensuring the chest rises with each breath. Be sure the air enters the lungs, not just the stomach.
        Alternating CPR: Continue alternating between 30 chest compressions and 2 rescue breaths (30:2 ratio).
        Continue Until Help Arrives:
      Continue performing CPR until the person starts to breathe on their own, or emergency medical help arrives.
      
        Accepted Artificial Respiration Methods
        Schafer Pressure Method:
      This technique involves applying rhythmic pressure to the chest to help restore breathing by mimicking the natural chest movement. It's designed to create a pressure change that stimulates lung expansion.
        Silvester Method (Arm Lift, Chest Pressure Method):
      The person’s arms are lifted over their head and then pulled downward to help expand the chest. Pressure is applied to the chest at intervals to encourage air movement.
        Nielson Arm Lift-Back Pressure Method:
      This method involves lifting the person's arms to open the chest cavity, followed by applying pressure to the back to help expel air from the lungs.
        Mouth-to-Mouth Method:
      This traditional method involves breathing directly into the person’s mouth to provide oxygen to the lungs. It’s commonly used when other methods are unavailable or ineffective.
      
        Duration and Transition to Natural Breathing:
        CPR Duration: For most cases, CPR should continue for 12 to 15 minutes or until signs of natural breathing are evident.
        Synchronized Breathing: Once the person begins to breathe independently, synchronize artificial respiration with natural breathing, matching the rhythm and depth until the crisis is completely resolved.

      Unit 2: Installation and Erection
        Foundations for Electrical Machinery:
      Proper foundations are crucial for ensuring the stability and efficiency of electrical machinery. The requirements vary for static and rotating machinery.
        Requirements for Static Machinery:
        Load-Bearing Capacity: The foundation must support the weight of the machinery and any dynamic forces it generates.
        Vibration Dampening: Static machinery like transformers can generate minimal vibrations. The foundation must be designed to absorb and dampen these vibrations.
        Material: To ensure longevity, the foundation should be constructed with durable materials like concrete or reinforced concrete.
        Level Surface: A flat and level foundation is critical to avoid tilting or uneven stress on the machinery.
        Moisture Resistance: The foundation must be resistant to moisture to avoid degradation over time.
      
        Requirements for Rotating Machinery:
        Dynamic Stability: Rotating machinery, like motors or generators, creates dynamic forces. The foundation must be designed to handle vibrations and rotational forces without destabilizing.
        Anti-Vibration Measures: Use anti-vibration pads or mounts to reduce wear and ensure smooth operation.
        Alignment Provisions: The foundation must allow for precise alignment of the machine with its coupling or drive system.
        Anchor Bolts: Strong anchor bolts must be embedded in the foundation to securely fix the machinery in place.
      
        Dimensions of the Foundation
      The dimensions of the foundation are determined based on specific machine requirements and ground conditions:
        Weight of the Foundation Block
      The weight of the foundation block is calculated using the empirical formula:
      WF = KF ×Wm 
      Where:
      WF = Weight of the foundation block
      Wm = Weight of the machine
      KF = Load factor, which depends on the type of load:	  KF=2 for static (solid) loads 
      KF=3 for dynamic loads
        Height of the Foundation
      \mathbit{H}_\mathbit{F}=\frac{\mathbit{W}_\mathbit{F}}{Area\ of\ base\ foundation\timesSpecific\ weight\ of\ material}
      
      
        Levelling and Alignment:
        Procedure for Levelling and Alignment
        Initial Preparation
        Clean the Foundation: Remove dirt, oil, and debris.
        Place the Machinery: Use appropriate shims or leveling pads for initial stability.
        Levelling
        Use a spirit level or laser level to ensure the machine is perfectly horizontal.
        Adjust shims or leveling screws to correct uneven surfaces.
        Alignment
        Align Shafts: For direct-coupled drives, ensure the shafts of the driver (e.g., motor) and driven equipment (e.g., pump) are coaxial.
        Measure Misalignment:
        Use dial gauges or laser systems to measure angular and offset misalignment.
        Aim for a gap correction of less than 0.05 mm.
        Tightening and Rechecking
      Tighten all gunmen to ensure no movement occurred during tightening.
        Final Verification
      Perform a break-in/run-in test to identify and address any defects in the installation.
        Documentation
      Record all activities for alignment, including tools used, measurements, and final results.
        Acceptance and Verification
        Conduct a third-party review if required.
        Validate alignment after the initial operation to ensure stability.
      
        Benefits of Proper Shaft Alignment
        Prolonged machine life and improved reliability.
        Reduced maintenance costs and spare part replacements.
        Enhanced safety and reduced operational vibrations.

        Ensure proper earthing of metallic sheathing and armoring.
        For transformers with capacities of 750 kVA or more, use single-core lead-covered cables.
        High Voltage:
        Use insulated cables and ensure proper earthing of cable boxes and sheathing.
        Bare Connections:
        Use bimetallic connectors when connecting copper transformer terminals to aluminum or ACSR conductors.
        Fire Risk Precautions
        Install fire-resisting barriers and provide separate isolation for oil-filled equipment.
        For large outdoor substations, install sprinkler systems activated by fire detection units.
        Ensure doors and partitions can resist fire for extended periods.
        Consider advanced precautions such as remote temperature monitoring, remote supply disconnection, and automatic fire-fighting systems.
        Safety Precautions
        Properly earth all metallic parts and use cable or terminal boxes to prevent accidental contact with live parts.
        Arrange connections to minimize the risk of electric shock.			
        Drying of Transformers
        When Required:
        Dry the transformer if insulation resistance is below 1 MΩ due to prolonged storage or cold conditions.
        Continue drying until insulation resistance stabilizes above 1 MΩ at 75°C.
        Methods:
        Short-Circuit Method: Heat windings by short-circuiting one winding and applying a voltage to another while lowering the oil level.
        Maintain proper ventilation and lagging to prevent moisture condensation.
        Regularly filter and test the dielectric strength of the oil.
        Precautions During Drying:
        Use only spirit thermometers (no mercury thermometers except in designated pockets).
        Do not exceed 85°C for oil or 90°C for any part in contact with oil.
        Keep fire-fighting equipment ready and avoid open flames.
      
      
        Induction Motor Installation (IS 900):
        Installation Work
        Record Plans: For significant installations, a complete set of record plans must be prepared, showing the full layout of the installation. This ensures everything is clearly documented.
        Safety Precautions: Moving parts must be properly guarded to minimize the risk of injury from hair, hands, or clothing being caught. The installation of mechanical protections is required, particularly for equipment covered under the Indian Factories Act.
        Inspection upon Receipt: Before installation, all equipment should be unpacked and checked against the manufacturer’s advice note to ensure no damage or loss occurred during transport. Verify that the motor and control gear meet the specifications in the purchase order.
      
        Foundation and Levelling
        Concrete Foundation: A solid and substantial concrete foundation is needed, designed to handle both static and dynamic loads, depending on the motor's size, weight, and the ground’s nature.
        Mounting: Motors mounted on walls should be placed on slide rails. Angle brackets should be securely attached to the wall to support the motor.
        Resilient Mounting: To prevent the transmission of vibrations, motors should be mounted rigidly or resiliently (using springs, rubber, or similar materials) if vibration could cause harm or inconvenience.
      
        Location of Motors and Control Apparatus
        Ventilation: Motors and control apparatus should be located in well-ventilated areas to prevent heat build-up, which could cause losses.
        Environmental Protection: Ensure the motor and control apparatus are protected from exposure to adverse conditions such as water, oil, corrosive liquids, or dust. If exposed to harsh conditions, they should be adequately enclosed.
        Safety from Heat: Equipment, particularly resistors that may reach high temperatures, should be spaced away from combustible materials like woodwork. If the casing temperature exceeds 90°C, it should be properly guarded to prevent accidental contact.
      
        Drying Out
        Insulation Resistance Below 1 MΩ: If the insulation resistance of the motor is below 1 MΩ/kV (minimum 1 MΩ when the motor is cold), the motor should be dried out before voltage is applied.
        Drying Principles: Apply heat gradually to drive out moisture from the windings. Avoid rapid heating, ensure good ventilation to remove moisture, and check insulation resistance periodically during drying.
        Drying Methods:
        Method 1: Use heaters or lamps around and inside the motor. Infrared lamps may also be used for drying the windings.
        Method 2: Block the motor so it cannot rotate, then apply low voltage to the starter terminals, ensuring the winding temperature doesn’t exceed 90°C.
        Method 3: Blow clean, dry hot air into the motor, ensuring the temperature doesn’t exceed 90°C.
        Continue drying until the insulation resistance rises to at least 1 MΩ/kV at 75°C.
      
        Commissioning:
        Pre-Operational Checks:
        Inspect mechanical parts for proper alignment and ensure all components are tightly secured.
        Verify the electrical connections and measure insulation resistance to ensure they meet the required standards.
        Trial Run:
        Run the motor without load to check for noise, vibrations, and overheating.
        Measure parameters such as current, voltage, and speed to ensure they fall within the specified limits.
        Ensure the motor operates smoothly, and observe for any unusual signs or irregularities.
        Starting Up:
        Conduct insulation resistance and continuity tests before starting the motor.
        Set protective devices to their minimum current and time settings to limit fault consequences.
        Gradually start the motor, checking for smooth operation and verifying that it does not run in the wrong direction. If needed, reverse the connections to correct the direction.
